                    <h2>What Makes Me So T-Shaped?</h2>
            <p>This podcast is an audio blog that I created in the hopes of creating excitement and generating a deeper understanding of the T-shaped student in relation to the VT-shaped model here at Virginia Tech. By talking about my personal experiences as a student in this audio format, information about the benefits of the VT-shaped program could be disseminated to niche audiences outside of the typical range of the Hokie Nation. Insofar as it was specifically addressed to members of the Virginia Tech community, this podcast provides a framework for the T aspects of the VT-shaped student, gives a direct example of what the T could potentially look like, and encourages the listener to think about the T-shaped elements of their own life.</p>

            <p>What I talk about in the podcast is nearly equal parts informative and equal parts reflective as I lay out the two main aspects of the T. I make an effort to give the audience detailed information about the T-shaped person that can be verified through various sources online, which I follow up with personal examples of application to my own academic experiences. Using this format, I help define the “base” and “stem” of the T, and explain specifically how they have come to be reflected in my life. Overall the information is presented in a way that helps explain the idea of the T-shaped student by relating it to the listener on a personal level.</p>

            <p>Because the subject matter is primarily personal in nature (kinda like this website!), the format of the podcast enhances the listener’s interest in the content and helps them understand how these concepts can also be applied to their own lives. I reveal my background, my interests, and future aspirations during the course of the podcast, and this effort put forth on my part will hopefully motivate the audience to consider the elements of the T for themselves just as seriously as I have. More than this, my personal story can provide an example for how one person’s T may look a little different than what may be expected, since I did not end up pursuing my original major as my area of expertise.</p>

            <p>In combination, the elements of my podcast serve to affirm the VT-shaped student model and its utility in the life of a modern student, such as myself. In the process of detailing what it means to be “T-shaped” in the professional and academic world, I encourage the listener to consider the T shape for themselves by giving them a direct example of how a fellow student has pursued a T-shaped education over the course of her life. By the end of the podcast, any listener who relates to the idea of the T-shaped person, whether a Hokie or not, will be informed enough to consider what the T might look like in their own lives, or what they hope it will look like in the future. The overall purpose of the podcast is to spread the word about the VT-shaped student, and I anticipate that the school will see a higher rate of interest and general knowledge of the program throughout the community as a result.</p>
