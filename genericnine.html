                            <h2>Hokiepedia for the Average Student</h2>
                            <p>We have an idea of what makes up our T and V, but how do we put these elements together for ourselves? With so many different options and potential paths to take, the process of finding one’s personal VT-shape, or even just one letter, can be a grueling one, hampered by the occasional misstep or failure. The way we interact with our community and the methods by which we access the resources that are available to us can have a huge impact on how well we succeed at that engagement. I personally believe that we at Virginia Tech can improve on our ability to utilize the numerous opportunities that help facilitate our growth as VT-shaped students and community members. By building an easier to access, more streamlined network of information that can benefit any user that wishes to learn about the activities, groups, and public events that are going on in the area, we will begin to see an array of fully VT-shaped individuals with the confidence of knowledge and diversity of experience that is needed in the modern world.</p>

                            <p>This is how I developed the idea of Hokiepedia, a multi-functional browser and database with a lot more information than GobblerConnect all in one place. This website will host links to the hundreds of academic, social, athletic, professional, artistic, and service groups and organizations that exist within the university, as well as in the surrounding New River Valley area itself. In addition, the site will contain a home page with news updates about featured groups, informational articles about upcoming events, an advanced search system that allows for categorization by type, major, or interest, and a personalized profile with favorites lists that allow users instant access to their preferred groups or topics. Visitors to the site can also use the search bar in the top right corner to find projects and activities most closely related to their search.</p>

                            <p>Students and faculty of Virginia Tech will be able to access this website right alongside those from outside of the Hokie community, but only those with a @vt.edu email address will be able to sign up for an account with a personal profile. With this site, account holders will be able to browse the many ways they can become active in the communities of VT, saving their favorite pages and interests for future reference. Whether looking for something new to try or keeping up to date with current organizational activities, any student or professional browsing Hokiepedia would be able to find a way to participate with or support a project, or group, with ease. This would be a highly beneficial tool for the development of the VT-shaped student as they search for organizations, teams, research projects, academic opportunities, and more, in order to further educate themselves and broaden their fields of knowledge.</p>

                            <p>This database helps affirm the VT-shaped model in the eyes of any new or returning student or faculty member, not to mention members of the NRV community. As a returning student with one completed degree, I can speak personally to the advantages of structuring one’s educational and professional development with the VT-shaped model in mind; furthermore, I can speak to the benefits that would result from having such ease of access to so many different kinds of events and information pertinent to personal growth at the professional level. A website or tool like Hokiepedia would be precisely the kind of website that I would like to use when trying to narrow down what student organizations, research projects, and job opportunities I would like to pursue in the future, or even tomorrow. In addition, this website would host information about volunteer work available throughout the area as well as on campus year round.</p>

                            <p>A resource like this is much needed by the members of the Tech community, particularly among those who are just beginning to develop their VT-shape and those who are attempting to re-invigorate their skills and knowledge within the VT-shaped student model. The anticipated ease of use for a website that functions both as a database and as a news bulletin would make the process of becoming VT-shaped seem like a much more achievable and appealing idea to new students who may become overwhelmed by all that is expected of them as they become adults, and all the different options that are available to them as students. Rather than being resigned to scouring numerous different department websites, reading multiple news sources, participating in a handful of social media platforms, and attending seemingly endless informational meetings in order to pick out one or two new groups or projects to join this year, a student may simply begin their search by browsing Hokiepedia, easily able to navigate by their major, their interests or hobbies, or by the type of work they are looking to do.</p>

                            <p>The ease of use and seamless integration of information from various kinds of sources proposed by this site would serve to enhance appreciation of the VT-shaped student model by new students, those returning to VT from an extended absence, or average students who are looking for ways to engage with this new model as it is being promoted across campus. If we want our students, faculty, and community members to reflect the VT-shaped model, we should strive to provide strong resources that allow them to do so. This website is a minor proposal for change in that it challenges the tools we have made available to our students and faculty so far. The VT-shaped student model and those at the Office of VT-Shaped Learning should consider expanding upon these tools to better disseminate information throughout the community and help our community members effectively utilize that information to become better students, teachers, and professionals, all of whom will come to represent the VT-shape  in the world today.</p>
